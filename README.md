## Purpose: 
The technical aspect of this project is to explore unsurpervised ML algorthims and their applications.
Most ML utilized to computer vision is recognition (classification) - a branch of ML that is based on supervised learning.
The focus of this propject is to explore another side of ML, unsupervised learning. In conjuction, by focusing on image 
creation rather than classification, I hope to explore what it means to create both mathematically and artistically. 
My hope is that this project will allow me to pathfind through the intersection of technological applications and art. 
Other goals for this work are to start a AI ART portfolio or bring this model or ML applications to a physcial space (art installations).
From this framework this is where I will begin my exploration. - Eduardo Ortega 6/9/2022
