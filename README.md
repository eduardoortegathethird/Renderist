Purpose: The technical aspect of this project is to explore unsurpervised learning ML algorthims and their applications. Some of my technilogical iterest lie into pivoting biomimcry for neuromorphic comutational design. Most of the ML utilized to cement quantative outcomes from studies is all from image classification - a branch of ML that is based in supervised learning. I want to explore the another branch of ML, unsupervised learning. By utilizing an axiom of image creation rather than image classification I hope to explore what it means to create both mathematically and artistically. My hope is that this project will allow me to explore self expression through the intersection of technological applications and art. From this framework this is where I will begin my exploration of what it means to intersect technology and art. - Eduardo Ortega 9/7/2020
